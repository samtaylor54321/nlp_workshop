    "Historically, NLP originally relied on hard-coded rules about a language.  In the 1990s, there was a change towards using statistical & machine learning approaches, but the complexity of natural language meant that simple statistical approaches were often not state-of-the-art. We are now currently in the midst of a major change in the move towards neural networks.  Because deep learning allows for much greater complexity, it is now achieving state-of-the-art for many things.\n",
